## What This App Is

A personal math-competition tutor powered by **ChatGPT 5.1**.

It doesn’t just solve problems.  
It teaches you how to solve them — by generating personalized subproblems that illuminate exactly the ideas you’re missing.

It works like a great human tutor:

- Understands what you wrote
- Sees your thinking process
- Identifies conceptual gaps
- Designs the right mini-problem on the spot
- Helps you bring the insight back

## The Learning Loop

**Problem → Work → Stuck → Subproblem → Insight → Return → Solve**

This is how real learning happens.

## Example Walkthrough

### Step 1 — Upload a Problem

You upload an AIME screenshot.  
ChatGPT 5.1 solves it behind the scenes but keeps the solution hidden.

### Step 2 — Start Working

The problem appears at the top.  
Your canvas below fills with your handwritten work.

### Step 3 — Get Stuck

You tap **I’m Stuck**.

ChatGPT 5.1 reviews:

- The problem
- Its own hidden solution
- Your handwritten scratch work

It replies (in the chat panel):

> “Nice progress. You’ve set up the structure correctly.  
> The missing idea is understanding how this expression behaves modulo 7.”

Then it gives you a subproblem:

> “Try this simpler modular example and see what pattern emerges.”

### Step 4 — Solve the Subproblem

You solve it.  
Tap **Done**.

The tutor explains:

> “Great. The modular trick you used here applies directly to the original expression.  
> Rewrite that expression mod 7 just like you did.”

Now the original problem unlocks.

### Step 5 — Finish Confidently

You complete the original problem, _having learned the idea_.

You may optionally reveal the official solution afterward.
